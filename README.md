ticket gadgets i wanted to also sell a product that would be a list of concerts going on sale daily  
what i was thinking would that it would be a portal or additional page that once they purchase they get access to it  it could be sold separately or packaged with the ticket counters  so when a user purchases access they would automatically get access to this addtional list or portal  
so i would want users to be able to see the list of every ticketmaster and livenation show going on presale or general public on sale   and have it have some search functionaliites, and a nice interface etc.   
i have also heard that for presale passwords they are hiddden in the source code and can be extracted that way
https://www1.ticketmaster.com/event/000056AB12876C9E, this is an example of a show from ticketmaster  
the goal would be to have a list of shows going on sale we would not be worried about tickets remaining   ave all shows going on pre and public sale. Did you check to see if possible to get the presale password from the source code  
One other thing would be. Say for members of this list. Once the show goes on sale. If we don’t have the password and say was able to get it a few minutes after it went on sale we would want to be able to give those customers an alert a new password was added. Email might be the easiest way. That’s what showsonsale.com does  
Also I a member canceled would need to take away access to the list  
Another thing to think of would be trying to limit it so only one account could be signed in at a time so people couldn’t share account
